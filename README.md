# Handmade classification neural network
The code is divided in two important parts:
* In the [main.py](https://github.com/yepedraza/hm-class-nn/blob/master/main.py) file a classification dataset was created by gaussian quantiles for two classes.
* In the [neuralNetwork.py](https://github.com/yepedraza/hm-class-nn/blob/master/neuralNetwork.py) the architecture of a neural network with a hidden layer was created using only mathematical resources with the help of the library numpy.

The neural network has some characteristics:
* Training and validation functions
  * Forward function
  * Back Propagation function (for training)
  * Gradient descent function (for training)
* Random parameters initialization 
* Hyperbolic tangent activation function
* Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function
* All the *hyperparameters* are worked in dictionaries
